                    A <strong>10 point merit system</strong> is deployed in depicting the performances of each candidate under the identified  categories. At this point, the outstanding performers in each category begin to surface and are grouped  according to their respective industries. Upon the completion of the initial process, the ratings of each  candidate are then merged to ascertain the overall performance in comparison to other players in the  relevant industry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The findings from the evaluation are regularly communicated to the panel of judges for review,  consideration and approval during the Judges’ Meetings. The regular communication with the judges  allow for new and relevant information to be endorsed and included in the performance and information  database of the candidates. As these efforts progress, eventual recipients of the awards begin to be  identified and shortlisted accordingly via the performance merit system. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the final process, these outstanding performers are again evaluated collectively by the panel of judges.  The final list of recipients is then concluded and endorsed officially prior to being revealed to the members  of the organising committee. The committee will then in turn be entrusted to inform the respective  recipients formally in writing. The BOSS Awards is accompanied by an official certificate from MAAYE and  a trophy, both presented to the recipients by the Guest of Honour at the Gala Dinner event organised to  commemorate and celebrate the achievements of the BOSS Award recipients.
