                <p>The Field is happening in Hall A & B on the ground floor of Menara MATRADE. There will be over 300 booths mixed between categories, industries and stages of your business, from the start-up lane to the ASEAN plots. If you have a business idea but don't have the funding? Come and sign up for the Pitch Arena and get a chance to present in front of investors, venture capitalists and Angel investors. Perhaps you want to promote you business apart from your booth; sign up for The Podium for a slot to speak and present your business to entire crowd.</p>
                <p>Maybe you want to show your skills in coding, join the developers bunk and sign up for the app competition. Or simply just demonstrate your skills and get new businesses.</p>
                <p>We even have a dedicated start-up lane for those newbies. We support you too! Set-up and start selling your business, but if your business is older than 3 years old you don't qualify. Although if your business has never been funded by an investor, and you merely bootstrapped your business then you qualify for the Bootstrap Jalan (itâ€™s slightly cheaper).</p>
                <p>Are you a designer? Are you in your own world of Alice in Wonderland? Then you can join the Design Exchange area. This is dedicated to the designers who make things creative & beautiful! It is aimed at creating a platform for a design community in Asia.</p>
                <p>The expo was designed to suit the businesses and interests of young entrepreneurs in ASEAN. Bringing all together under one roof to share ideas, expand your borders and grow your businesses, or simply experience the energy for 2 days. Bringing ASEAN to you!</p>
